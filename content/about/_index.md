Hi, there,

I'm David, a Software Engineer. Kind of Full Stack, but my major is Goland. 

As a software engineer with 6 years of experience, I have been dealing with different scenarios from a variety of given backgrounds. I focused on internal systems and have experience in the EC industry and digital marketing. I've led several project refactors and am devoted to producing reliable and scalable code. Also experienced in handling concurrency situations.

Techical Skills:
- Go / JavaScript
- Familiar with PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB/Redis.
- Familiar with Gin/gRPC, Protobuf format. Experienced in project with Iris/Beego.

Well, that was a part of my resume, which doesn't include a lot of fun. I started this blog because I wish to open some discussion or interaction with people from all walks of life. 

I've been working in start-up company and come along with it from an early stage. Through this I was exposed to a lot of thinking about companies' business and technologies' usage. So if you want to some feedback about your business idea, feel free to reach out to me. [âœ‰email](mailto:david.chou93@gmail.com)

Except serious stuffs, I'm also seeking for enrichment in personal life. Growing up in China, I'm kind of newbie of having fun (LOL). Although this country has great history and various of culture, it is not attractive to me as a place to live in. I'm planning to migrate to Canada or Australia. 

Each culture has its own characteristic as well as share commons with some others. I've chatted with some foreigner before and found it was quite interesting. So if you want to know better of Chinese culture or sharing your culture with me, go ahead! 

Blog seems like a legacy in the history of internet and it has covered a great part of it. Although bloggers have become much less than before, I'm tring to connect to the world with this old fashioned way.
